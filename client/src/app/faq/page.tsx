      <Question question="How are boss profits calculated?">
        <p>
          The &quot;value&quot; of a boss is the average profit per kill. It is
          calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <p>Item Value = Price * Droprate</p>
        <p>Boss Value = Sum of all Item Values - Entry Cost</p>

      <Question question="Where do the drop rates come from?">
        <p>
          I use the drop rates listed on the{" "}

          These might not be 100% accurate but they are the best I could find.

      <Question question="How are gem profits calculated?">
        <span>
          The &quot;Level profit&quot; is the price-difference between the game
          at level 1 and its max (uncorrupted) level.
          <p>
            &quot;Level + Corrupt&quot; is the expected profit from levelling a
            gem from level 1 and corrupting a gem from.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Level + Quality + Corrupt&quot; is the expected profit from
            levelling a gem from level 1, making it 20% quality, and then
            corrupting it.
          </p>
        </span>
      </Question>
      <Question question='What is "Experience Adjusted Profits?"'>
        <p>
          This makes the profit normalized with respect to the required
          experience to level a gem to max level. Awakened and exceptional gems
          are generally more profitable to level at a per gem basis. However
          they also require around 5x more experience to reach max level
          compared to a normal / transfigured gem.

      <Question question="X item has the wrong price!">
        <p>
          Currently all item prices are fetched from pulled from{" "}
          <PoeNinjaLink /> and <PoeWatchLink /> so if those prices are wrong
          then the prices on this site will be as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the addition of Faustus (Currency Exchange) some item prices will
          generally be slightly off since items traded on the Currency Exchange
          is not publicly available.
